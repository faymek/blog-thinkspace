### Download
1. SJTU-putao
2. BaiduNetDisk
3. DownloadIy.ir

### Installation
1. Mount dvd1.iso

  ```
  mkdir /home/<username>/Matlab  
  sudo mount -t auto -o loop *dvd1.iso所在的绝对路径 /home/<user name>/Matlab
  ```
  We created a temporary folder to mount dvd1.iso and dvd2.iso(later). Please do not mount dvd2.iso before installation.


2. Installation

   ```
   sudo /home/<username>/Matlab/install
   ```
   Notice: The installation will be terminated if the terminal is at /home/<username>/Matlab .
   At first, you choose offline verification, and the license number lies in readme.txt in the "Crack" folder. Copy and paste the very first key (begin with 09806).


3. Mount dvd2.iso
  When the installation process goes to 75%, it asks for the dvd2.iso. We open another terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T), and do:

  ```
  sudo mount -t auto -o loop *dvd2.iso所在的绝对路径 /home/<username>/Matlab
  ```

  Then we go back to the interface of installation to countinue.

  ​


4. Umount

   ```
   sudo umount /home/<username>/Matlab
   sudo umount /home/<username>/Matlab 
   sudo rm -r /home/<username>/Matlab 
   ```

   You need umount it twice because we mounted it twice. And you can choose to delete the temporary folder.

5. Crack

   You'd better open Matlab later.

   ```
   sudo mkdir /usr/local/MATLAB/R2017a/bin/licenses/  
   sudo cp license_standalone.lic所在的目录 /usr/local/MATLAB/R2017a/bin/licenses/  
   sudo cp libmwservices.so所在的目录 /usr/local/MATLAB/R2017a/bin/glnxa64/  
   ```

   /usr/local/MATLAB/ is the default installation folder of Matlab.

   ​

6.  Launch

   ```
   sudo /usr/local/MATLAB/R2017a/bin/matlab 
   ```

   At first launch, you may need to provide the license file. Locate it and finish activation.

7.  Shortcut

   Some approaches to launch matlab conveniently.

   a. matlab-support
   Go to software center and install matlab-support. Or enter:

   ```
   sudo apt install matlab-support
   ```

   Then you can launch it when searching applications. 

   You may find problems named Java error. The issue was that the .matlab folder in the Home directory was owned by root after this install. Try:

   ```
   sudo chown [yourusername]:[yourusername] ~/.matlab
   cd ~/.matlab
   sudo chown -R [yourusername]:[yourusername] *
   ```

   but still some questions:

   > I found that changing only the ~/.matlab folder to be mine would allow the software to launch with -nojvm but the other start options showed errors. I originally thought this was a java issue, but actually it was hitting java IO exceptions from the bad folder permissions.

   b. alias
   Change ~/.bashrc and add permanent alias.
